# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet, including data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software.

Cloud-based storage makes it possible to save files to a remote database and retrieve them on demand. 

Three models of cloud service:

Software as a Service (SaaS):  SaaS utilizes the internet to deliver applications, which are managed by a third-party vendor, to its users.

A majority of SaaS applications run directly through web browser, which means they do not require any downloads or installations on the client side.

Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
