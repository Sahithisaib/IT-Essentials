# Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC):
SDLC is a process used in softwarre industry to design, develop and test their software.

It consists of six stages:

Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis 

Stage 2: Defining Requirements 

Stage 3: Designing the Product Architecture  

Stage 4: Building or Developing the Product  

Stage 5: Testing the Product  

Stage 6: Deployment in the Market and Maintenance 

SDLC Models
-
Different models are used in this process of SDLC and these are called as "Software Development Process Models".

Most important and popoular models are"

Waterfall Model: In waterfall model the project is broken down to sequential steps and each phase is dependent on the previous one.

Iterative Model: In this model, a first version of software is built and proceeds to the next if no changes are required. The same process continues iteratively until the end product is received.

Spiral Model: It is a risk driven model, it guides team to adapt to various models, based on the risk patterns.

V-Model: It is an extension of waterfall model, where testing is planned in parallel to the corrsponding development.

Big Bang Model: This model does not have any specific process or requirements, generally used in small or academic projects.

**Agile Model**: 
Agile model is based on the iterative development where tasks are broken into smaler iteration and generlly does not involve long tterm planning.

Plans regarding the number of iterations, the duration and the scope of each iteration are clearly defined in advance.

The division of the entire project into smaller parts helps to minimize the project risk and to reduce the overall project delivery time requirements. 

Each iteration involves a team working through a full software development life cycle.

**Agile Testing Methods**

Scrum 

Crystal 

Dynamic Software Development Method(DSDM) 

Feature Driven Development(FDD) 

Lean Software Development 

eXtreme Programming(XP)
