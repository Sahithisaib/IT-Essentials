# Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC):
SDLC is a process used in softwarre industry to design, develop and test their software.

It consists of six stages:

Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis 

Stage 2: Defining Requirements 

Stage 3: Designing the Product Architecture  

Stage 4: Building or Developing the Product  

Stage 5: Testing the Product  

Stage 6: Deployment in the Market and Maintenance 

SDLC Models
-
Different models are used in this process of SDLC and these are called as "Software Development Process Models".

Most important and popoular models are"

Waterfall Model: In waterfall model the project is broken down to sequential steps and each phase is dependent on the previous one.

Iterative Model: In this model, a first version of software is built and proceeds to the next if no changes are required. The same process continues iteratively until the end product is received.

Spiral Model: It is a risk driven model, it guides team to adapt to various models, based on the risk patterns.

V-Model: It is an extension of waterfall model, where testing is planned in parallel to the corrsponding development.

Big Bang Model: This model does not have any specific process or requirements, generally used in small or academic projects.

**Agile Model**:
