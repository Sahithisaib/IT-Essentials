# Testing

Testing is the process of executing a program with the aim of finding errors.

Manual testing: Here all the testing is done manually.

Automation Testing: We write a script to automatte our testing.

Functional : We test the code, actual parts of the code

BlackBox: We give input and expect output but we do not check the internal working.

White Box: we check the internal functioning. We check actual code.

Unit Testing: In unit testing, we check the smallest units of code.

Integration Testing: It is where we combine group of unit testing components and check if they perform well together without errors.

Reggression Testing: This type of testing makes sure that the whole component works properly even after adding components to the complete program.  

Smoke Testing: This test is done to make sure that software under testing is ready or stable for further testing.

Alpha Testing: This is a type of validation testing. It is a type of acceptance testing which is done before the product is released to customers.

Beta Testing: The beta test is conducted at one or more customer sites by the end-user of the software.

System Testing: This software is tested such that it works fine for the different operating systems.

Stress Testing: In this, we give unfavorable conditions to the system and check how they perform in those conditions.

Performance Testing: It is designed to test the run-time performance of software within the context of an integrated system. It is used to test the speed and effectiveness of the program.

Object-Oriented Testing: This testing is a combination of various testing techniques that help to verify and validate object-oriented software.
