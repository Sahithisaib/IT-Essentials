# OOPS Concepts

Abstraction: 

Abstraction in Java refers to hiding the implementation details of a code and exposing only the necessary information to the user. 

It provides the ability to simplify complex systems by ignoring irrelevant details and reducing complexity.

Inheritance:

Inheritance in Java is a concept that acquires the properties from one class to other classes; for example, the relationship between father and son. 

Inheritance in Java is a process of acquiring all the behaviours of a parent object.

Inheritance lets one class acquire the properties and attributes of another class.

We can inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class

superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from

To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.

Polymorphism:

Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

Polymorphism is the task that performs a single action in different ways.

Polymorphism in Java allows us to use these inherited properties to perform different tasks.

Encapsulation:

Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users.

Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. 

In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.
