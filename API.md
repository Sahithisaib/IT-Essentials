# API

APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols.

API stands for Application Programming Interface. In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any software with a distinct function. Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses

**4 Different ways of API working:**

SOAP APIs:

These APIs use Simple Object Access Protocol. Client and server exchange messages using XML. This is a less flexible API that was more popular in the past.
-------------------------------------------------------------
RPC APIs

These APIs are called Remote Procedure Calls. The client completes a function (or procedure) on the server, and the server sends the output back to the client.

Websocket APIs

Websocket API is another modern web API development that uses JSON objects to pass data. A WebSocket API supports two-way communication between client apps and the server. The server can send callback messages to connected clients, making it more efficient than REST API.

REST APIs

These are the most popular and flexible APIs found on the web today. The client sends requests to the server as data. The server uses this client input to start internal functions and returns output data back to the client.

**Tpes of API**

Private APIs
These are internal to an enterprise and only used for connecting systems and data within the business.

Public APIs 
These are open to the public and may be used by anyone. There may or not be some authorization and cost associated with these types of APIs.

Partner APIs 
These are only accessible by authorized external developers to aid business-to-business partnerships.

Composite APIs 
These combine two or more different APIs to address complex system requirements or behaviors. 

**API Endpoints**
API endpoints are the final touchpoints in the API communication system. These include server URLs, services, and other specific digital locations from where information is sent and received between systems.
