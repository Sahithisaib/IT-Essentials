# Version Control:

Version control is a class of systems responsible for managing changes to computer programs, documents, large web sites, or other collections of information.

Version control facilitates a continuous, simple way to develop software by allowing software teams to keep track of changes tto the code, while enhancing communication, and collaboration with team members.

Most popular version control systems are:

Mercurial- Mercurial is a distributed version control system that offers simple branching and merging capabilities which enable rapid scaling and collaborative development, with an intuitive interface.
