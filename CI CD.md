# CI CD

CI/CD bridges the gaps between development and operation activities and teams by enforcing automation in building, testing and deployment of applications.  

CI/CD services compile the incremental code changes made by developers, then link and package them into software deliverables. 

DevOps practices involve continuous development, continuous testing, continuous integration, continuous deployment and continuous monitoring of software applications throughout its development life cycle.

 CI helps streamline code changes, thereby increasing time for developers to make changes and contribute to improved software. 

 Continuous delivery (CD) is the automated delivery of completed code to environments like testing and development.

 Continuous deployment is the next step of continuous delivery. Every change that passes the automated tests is automatically placed in production, resulting in many production deployments. 

 Jenkins is a powerful application that allows continuous integration and continuous delivery of projects, regardless of the platform we are working on.
