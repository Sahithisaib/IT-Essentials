# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet, including data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software.

Cloud-based storage makes it possible to save files to a remote database and retrieve them on demand. 

Three models of cloud service:

Software as a Service (SaaS):  SaaS utilizes the internet to deliver applications, which are managed by a third-party vendor, to its users.

A majority of SaaS applications run directly through web browser, which means they do not require any downloads or installations on the client side.

Platform as a Service (PaaS): PaaS delivers a framework for developers that they can build upon and use to create customized applications. 

All servers, storage, and networking can be managed by the enterprise or a third-party provider while the developers can maintain management of the applications.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
