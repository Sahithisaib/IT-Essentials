# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet, including data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software.

Cloud-based storage makes it possible to save files to a remote database and retrieve them on demand. 

Three models of cloud service:

Software as a Service (SaaS):  SaaS utilizes the internet to deliver applications, which are managed by a third-party vendor, to its users.

A majority of SaaS applications run directly through web browser, which means they do not require any downloads or installations on the client side.

Platform as a Service (PaaS): PaaS delivers a framework for developers that they can build upon and use to create customized applications. 

All servers, storage, and networking can be managed by the enterprise or a third-party provider while the developers can maintain management of the applications.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), are made of highly scalable and automated compute resources.

IaaS is fully self-service for accessing and monitoring computers, networking, storage, and other services.

IaaS allows businesses to purchase resources on-demand and as-needed instead of having to buy hardware outright.

Uses of Cloud Computing:

Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)  

Hybrid cloud and multicloud 

Test and development 

Big data analytics 

Cloud storage 

Disaster recovery  

Data backup  

AWS:
--

Amazon web service is an online platform that provides scalable and cost-effective cloud computing solutions.

AWS is a broadly adopted cloud platform that offers several on-demand operations like compute power, database storage, content delivery, etc., to help corporates scale and grow. 

Region: Independent Geographic Area.

Availability Zone: Multiple isolated data centers located in a region.

Some services offered by AWS:

S3, EC2, Athena, Dynamo DB, Redshift, CloudFront, SNS, SES, SQS, Rekognition, ELB, EMR, Kinesis.

AWS security Services: IAM, KMS, ACM, WAF, Inspector.

AWS Development and Devops Services: CloudFormation, CodeCommit, CodeeDeploy, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, CodeStar.

Azure:
--
Azure is a public cloud computing platformâ€”with solutions including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) that can be used for services such as analytics, virtual computing, storage, networking, and much more. 

Azure Virtual Machines: Provides options to create Windows or Linux virtual machines with customization. 

Service Fabrics: Platform that process of developing micro services and application life cycle managemment easier.

Functions: Build applications with serverless computing(can use any language).

**Networking services:**
Azure Content Delivery Network: Facilitates content delivery with an emphasis on reduced load time.

Express Route: Connect on-premises network to Azure through private network.

Azure DNS: Host user domains, provides high availability.

Azure Virtual Network: enables azure resources to connect with each other.
Traffic Manager, Load Balancer, Azure VPN Gateway.

Storage:

DataLake -provides scalable data storage.
Block Storage- Places data to different tiers

Queue Storage- message queing for large workloads
File Stoage- File sharing
Table storage- NoSqll key-value store, deploy semi-structured datasets.

Azure Search- develop, mobile or web applications
Logic Apps- Allows to build integration slutions, perfoms SaaS
Web Apps- create deploy scale web applications
Mobile Apps- develop apps for ios or windows, androis

Azure Container serviceS:

Kubernetes:Eases process of container integration and deployment, uses virtual networks, crypto keys to ensure security.
container instances

SQL Databse- relational cloud database service
Azure cosmos DB- multi-model database, high security, low latency

Azure Active Directory: manage user identifties and ensure secure resources.

Azure AD B2c: provides customer identity and access management.
Azure sec center: complete view of security on premise and cloud

Monitoring and mangmt:
azure advidor: recommend guide for azures best practices

network watcher:
monitor, diagnose, understanding working ogf network , also undtnd traffic 
az resource manger; ensure our resource are manged and deployed at consistent rate
